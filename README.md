# Personal Asset Tracking App

A secure, privacy-focused personal asset tracking application that provides real-time portfolio visualization with local data storage.

## üéØ Application Overview

This application is designed to provide a secure and private personal asset tracking tool. All data is stored locally on the device without any cloud synchronization. The core functionality uses real-time market data to calculate the total value of user assets and displays the proportion of each asset (cash and stocks) in a pie chart format, with all values unified in TWD (Taiwan Dollar) equivalent.

## üîê Security & Authentication
